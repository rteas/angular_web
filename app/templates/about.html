		<h4>
			Hi!
		</h4>
		</br>
		<h4>
			My major is Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am a graduating senior at <a href="https://uci.edu">University of California, Irvine </a> (UCI). Zot zot zot!
		</h4>
		</br>
		<h4>
			I am interested in developing software to solve interesting problems and am willing to tackle difficult problems while I'm still fairly young!
		</h4>
		</br>
		<h4>
			One of my interests is gaming, which I plan to hopefully start on (as a hobby) soon. As I've taken a video game development class, I found game development to also be interesting, difficult, and fun! (Of course, I do find software development in general quite interesting). See my (unfinished) code <a href="https://github.com/rteas/Hurricane">here!</a> Also the group code of a semi-finished one <a href="https://github.com/atymisk/Hurricane">here!</a>
		</h4>
		</br>

		<h4>
			Currently, I am job hunting (graduating this June!) so please <a href="#/resume">contact</a> me if you're interested!
